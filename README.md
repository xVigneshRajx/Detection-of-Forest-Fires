**Intorduction**

In forests, fires can be started by humans or by natural causes. Naturally, fire occurs when there is an intense drought, high temperatures, lightning, or dry leaves and scobs that catch fire. Fires are also caused by human activity, such as using carried fire or tossing cigarettes, particularly in forested regions.

+ Thus, human-caused fires are detected earlier than those that occur naturally. When a region catches fire, many variables come into play. The dry, hot weather acts as a fire starter. Since there is always a risk of fire, every area that experiences fire will experience high temperatures. Thus, one of the elements that can aid in the identification of fire incidents is a rise in temperature.
+ However, since sunshine may also cause a region's temperature to rise, we cannot just rely on temperature to identify fires. In order to find the fire, we may also measure the CO and CO2 gas concentrations in that area. However, when someone smokes in that area, CO and CO2 gases can also be produced, which increases the risk of false alarms, such as erroneous fire event detection.
+ By using different machine learning methods to determine whether or not there is fire, we can improve the accuracy of our fire event predictions. Additionally, we will use bespoke input to test and train the machine to determine whether or not there is a fire. We will also compute these ML algorithms' precision, recall, and accuracy. Thus, we can prevent the negative effects of forest fires on our environment, wildlife, and way of life.
